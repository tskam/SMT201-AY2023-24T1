## Overview

This handout provides the context, task, expectations and grading criteria of Take-home Exercise 2. Students must review and understand them before getting started with the take-home exercise.

## Setting the Scene

[Nusantara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusantara_(planned_city)), officially known as the Capital City of Nusantara (Indonesian: Ibu Kota Nusantara, IKN), is the future capital of Indonesia, scheduled to be inaugurated on 17 August 2024, coinciding with Indonesian Independence Day.  

The city is designed for [smart and sustainability and protecting its surrounding Kalimantan forests](https://www.uncrd.or.jp/content/documents/860420221110_SC%20Training_Presentation_Mohammed%20Ali%20Berawi-en.pdf), targeting 80% of mobility to be supported by public transport, cycling, or walking and drawing all of its energy from renewable sources and allocating 10% of its area to food production.  It is expected to encompass an area of 2,560 km2 (990 sq mi), surrounded by hilly landscapes, a forest, and a natural bay.

The site is situated on the east coast of the island of Borneo, specifically in the province of East Kalimantan.

## Task

“We want our new capital city to become the centre of research and innovation at international level. So we need to build world-class universities here,” Mr. Widodo, the president of Indonesia told the media. 

In this take-home exercise, you are required to apply GIS analysis and multi-criteria evaluation method to identify site suitable for the proposed new university by using the criteria below:

+ It should be between 450-500 hectares in size
+ It should avoid steep slope.  Steep slope developments are relative more costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly.
+ It should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.
+ It should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current major settlement areas.
+ It should avoid natural forest as much as possible.
+ It should be highly accessible via road transport.

## The study

The selected suitable sites must ne located in **Sepaku** district (kecamatan in Bahasa Indonesia) of East Kalimantan.

## The Data

For the purpose of this project, the following data sources are recommended but students are welcome to include other appropriate data.

- [Landuse/Landcover (LULC) 2019](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/09/download-shp-tutupan-lahan-tahun-2019.html).  The word *tutupan lahan* means landcover in bahasa Indonesia.

- [DEM SRTM 30m](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/download-dem-srtm-30-meter-se-indonesia.html)

- [Administrative Boundaries 2020: Province, Regency, District, Urban/rural sub-district](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/06/download-shapefile-shp-batas-desa.html)

- [Rupa Bumi Indonesia (RBI) Provinsi Kalimantan Timur Perwilayah (Kabupaten/Kota)](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-kalimantan-timur.html). The term *rupabumi* means topographic.  This data repository provides a comprehensive collection of topographical data layers of East Kalimantan. 

- [OSM data for Kalimantan](https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/indonesia/kalimantan.html).

## Take-home Exercise Deliverable

### GIS data repository

The GIS repository includes but not limited to geospatial data compiled and derived, QGIS project file and data dictionary. It must be in a single zipped file (i.e. .zip). The geospatial data must be stored in a GeoPackage database format. The data dictionary can be in either MS Word document or edited into the GIS data. The project deliverable must be uploaded onto eLearn.

::: {.callout-note}
For Mac users, you can save the raster data in geotiff format.  Please do keep these data in a single folder called geotiff.
:::

### Take-home Exercise Report

You are required to edit your take-home exercise report in MS Word format. The take-home exercise report, beside others, should include all the thematic maps prepared and their respective discussion.

More importantly, the report must provide a **reproducible** step-by-step guide on the following process:

-   data compilation, extraction and integration,
-   data cleaning, preparation and wrangling,
-   GIS analysis (including tabular and graphical analysis), and
-   GIS maps design.


::: {.callout-note}
**Reproducible** means that readers are able to perform the same analysis and obtain similar results by using the same data sets and by following the step-by-step guide.
:::

The title of the report should be in the form of *SMT201_AY2023-24T1_Take-home_Exercise2*.

::: {.callout-warning}
This is an individual exercise. You are required to work on the take home exercise and prepare submission individually.
:::

## Grading

-   Quality of the GIS data model built (including metadata) (20 marks),
-   Appropriateness of the GIS methods used (20 marks),
-   Quality of GIS maps prepared (20 marks),
-   Reproducibility of the GIS processes (20 marks)
-   Ability to provide correct interpretation of the analysis results and to recommend appropriate alternatives (20 marks).

## Submission Date

The take-home exercise deliverable must be uploaded on eLearn by the submission deadline stated below.

Due Date: **15th October 2023, 11:59pm (midnight)**.
