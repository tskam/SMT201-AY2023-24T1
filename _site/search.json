Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\nThe project is to be done in a team. You are required to form a project team of 2-3 members by the second week of the academic term. Each project team must start thinking about their project ideas from week 8 onward. You are expected to discuss your project topic and scope of works with the instructor between week 8-9 of the academic term. A project website must be prepared and will be linked to this page by the end of week 10."

A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!"
