You will also learn how to collect, process and analyse spatially related issues using real world data. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\n\nThe project is to be done in a team. You are required to form a project team of **2-3 members** by the second week of the academic term. Each project team must start thinking about their project ideas from week 8 onward. You are expected to discuss your project topic and scope of works with the instructor between week 8-9 of the academic term. A project website must be prepared and will be linked to this page by the end of week 10.\n\n## Topic\n\nYou are required to choose one of the sub-theme provided below:\n\n**To Be Confirmed!**\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nThe project will comprise of, but not limited to the followings steps:\n\n-   Selection of project focus and conducting literature review.\n-   Preparing proposal and project website.\n-   Data collection, extraction, integration, transformation and wrangling.\n-   Designing and building GIS model and database.\n-   Performing GIS analysis.\n-   Preparing poster and project webpage.\n\n## Project Milestone\n\n-   Formulation of project team: by week 2 before lesson\n-   Assemble GIS data: from week 7 onward\n-   Create project website : by week 8\n-   Submission of project poster: 8th Nov. 2023, 11:59PM (mid-night).\n-   Townhall presentation: 14th Nov 2023 (Tuesday), at 12:00-2:00pm. Venue: LKSLIB Basement concourse. Students are required to be at the venue latest by 11:30am to setup your project poster.\n-   Submission of project artifacts and update project webpage: 19th November 2023 at 11.59pm (mid-night)\n\n## Grading\n\nThe GIS project will account for 35% of your final grade in the course. The distribution of marks for each stage of the project are as follows:\n\n-   Townhall presentation (peer evaluation) 15%\n-   Project poster 15%\n-   Project website and report 30%\n-   Minutes of Meeting 10%\n-   Project artifact 30%\n\nThe course instructor will consider strongly the novelty of the idea (If it has never been done before, you will get lots of credit!), how it addresses the problem at hand, the methodology you employ in doing the research, and your technical skill in implementing the idea.\n\nIn small group projects, each person will be graded individually. A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\n\n## Townhall Poster Presentation\n\nA townhall presentation will be held on 14th November 2023 (Tuesday) between 11.30am - 2.30pm. The venue will be at SMU Basement Concourse.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### Minutes of Meeting\n\nTo formulate the project proposal, you are required to have at least one round of brain-storming session and take down minutes of the discussion, disagreements, and consensus made within the team in the form of **Minutes of Meeting**. At least three differences should be included and a clear documentation on how the final decisions were reached must be provided. The Minutes of Meeting should also record the division of labour and the considerations involved in the decision made.\n\nThe following links provided useful guides on how to prepare the minutes of a meeting:\n\n1.

[How To Write Effective Meeting Minutes withTemplates and Samples](https://www.wildapricot.com/blog/how-to-write-meeting-minutes)\n\n### Project Website\n\n#### Project Github\n\nAt the beginning of the project, project teams are required to create a project Github. The project Github should include all the materials used to develop the project and the written materials such as proposal, poster and project report. It must be used to maintain a complete project versioning including the application and project documents. The Github link must be included in the project webpage. By the end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of the Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The Github link also must be provided on eLearn.\n\n#### Project Website\n\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using either [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html). It will be disseminated by using [Netfity](https://www.netlify.com/) web server.\n\n-   The title of your project,\n-   A short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, methodology and key findings, and\n-   The project proposal.\n    -   Motivation of the project\n    -   Project objective\n    -   Data\n    -   Scope of work\n    -   Project schedule including a Gannt chart\n-   Methodology\n    -   a detail documentation of the methods used.\n-   Results and Discussion\n-   Lesson learned\n\n### Poster\n\nThe poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information:\n\n-   Issues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems that your project addresses.\n-   Motivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\n-   Approach - A description of the GIS analysis and other urban analysis techniques you used to solve the problem.\n-   Results - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.\n-   Future Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\n\nThe dimensions for the poster must conform to the International Standards Organization (ISO) poster size format (A1).\n\n-   Size = ISO A1 (594 × 841mm or 23.39 × 33.11inci)\n-   Resolution = 300dpi or above\n-   File format = jpeg\n\nPlease ensure that the poster is in high resolution.\n\nThe poster will be considered as a final deliverable. So don't forget to apply good visual design principles to both your poster and project report.\n\nNote: The course instructor will be responsible for printing your poster. You are required to upload your posters to the project webpage of your project one week and your project Dropbox before the poster presentation.\n\nBelow are sample posters for your reference:\n\n-   [Hut of North](https://wiki.smu.edu.sg/1920t1smt201/G1-Group12_Poster)\n-   [What's Best for Jurong West](https://wiki.smu.edu.sg/1920t1smt201/G2-Group07_Poster)\n\n### Final Deliverable\n\nThe final deliverable will include:\n\n-   Fully updated project webpage\n-   Project Poster on project webpage\n-   Project Report on project webpage\n-   Project artifact, the complete GIS project folder including but not limited to raw data, process data, QGIS project file, and output maps.\n\n#### Project Report\n\nThe project report should focus on but not limited to the followings:\n\n-   A detail discussion of the GIS analysis process and functions used.\n-   A comprehensive discussion of the analysis results.\n-   A collection of analytical maps (can be statics or interactive web maps)\n\n#### Submission instruction\n\nThe project artefact is due (submitted to LMS Dropbox) by the end of the day on 19th November 2023 at 11.59pm (mid-night).\n\n## Sample Projects\n\nNote that the following examples are for references purposes.
