You will also learn how to collect, process and analyse spatially related issues using real world data. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\n\nThe project is to be done in a team. You are required to form a project team of **2-3 members** by the second week of the academic term. Each project team must start thinking about their project ideas from week 8 onwards. You are expected to discuss your project topic and scope of work with the instructor between week 8-9 of the academic term. A project website must be prepared and will be linked to this page by the end of week 10.\n\n## Topic\n\nIn recent years, a slew of record-breaking natural disasters has devastated communities around the world with unprecedented intensity and frequency.   For example, in this September, the world saw two devastating disaster events within two days of each other, namely the Morocco earthquake on 8th September 2023 and Libya flood caused by the collapsed of Derna dam on 10th September 2023.  Both have caused large-scale destruction of infrastructure and thousands of tragic deaths and injuries.  As this worrying trend shows no signs of slowing, the importance of investing in and incorporating advanced Geographic Information (GI)  technologies into each phase of the disaster planning and response framework cannot be overstated. While we cannot stop disasters from happening completely, GI technologies can mitigate risk and damages to infrastructure by helping to track, predict, and prepare for disasters, and ultimately assist in recovery and relief. \n\nAssume the role of being a GIS team of an international organisation focusing on humanitarian affairs and disaster mitigation and management, your team are tasked to explore the potential used of GIS and remote sensing technologies in urban flood disaster mitigation and management. The used case must be developed based on the recent Libya dam collapsed and its subsequent flooding of Derna City. \n\nYou are required to choose one of the theme provided below:\n\n- Theme 1: Urban Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Change Detection for Flood Mapping Applications of Satellite Remote Sensing.\n\n- Theme 2: GIS-based Accessibility Analysis and Mapping of Emergency Evacuation Centres and Medical Services.\n\n- Theme 3: Integrating GIS and Remotely Sensed Data for Urban Flood Loss Assessment and Recovery Planning.\n\n## The Data\n\n- Derna_city_250m_hexagon consists of a collection 250m hexagons defining the study area.  It is in ESRI shapefile format and is available in the GIS project folder of eLearn.\n\n- GIS data layer can be downloaded but not limited to [OSM Libya](https://download.geofabrik.de/africa/libya.html) at Geofabrik and [Libya Floods](https://data.humdata.org/event/f1c3a777-4079-49fb-9d64-12a72f46f1e3) at Humanitarian Data Exchange portal.\n\n- Satellite images can be downloaded from but not limited to [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) and [Opernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home) \n\n## Scope of Work\n\nThe project will comprise of, but not limited to the followings steps:\n\n-   Selection of project focus and conducting literature review.\n-   Preparing proposal and project website.\n-   Data collection, extraction, integration, transformation and wrangling.\n-   Designing and building GIS model and database.\n-   Performing GIS analysis.\n-   Preparing poster and project webpage.\n\n## Project Milestone\n\n-   Formulation of project team: by week 2 before lesson\n-   Assemble GIS data: from week 7 onwards\n-   Create project website : by week 8\n-   Submission of project poster: 8th Nov. 2023, 11:59PM (mid-night).\n-   Townhall presentation: 14th Nov 2023 (Tuesday), at 12:00-2:00pm. Venue: LKSLIB Basement concourse. Students are required to be at the venue latest by 11:30am to setup your project poster.\n-   Submission of project artifacts and update project webpage: 19th November 2023 at 11.59pm (mid-night)\n\n## Grading\n\nThe GIS project will account for 35% of your final grade in the course. The distribution of marks for each stage of the project are as follows:\n\n-   Townhall presentation (peer evaluation) 15%\n-   Project poster 15%\n-   Project website and report 30%\n-   Minutes of Meeting 15%\n-   Project artifact 25%\n\nThe course instructor will consider strongly the novelty of the idea (If it has never been done before, you will get lots of credit!), how it addresses the problem at hand, the methodology you employ in doing the research, and your technical skill in implementing the idea.\n\nIn small group projects, each person will be graded individually. A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well-defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\n\n## Townhall Poster Presentation\n\nA townhall presentation will be held on 14th November 2023 (Tuesday) between 11.30am - 2.30pm. The venue will be at SMU Basement Concourse.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### Minutes of Meeting\n\nTo formulate the project proposal, you are required to have at least one round of brain-storming session and take down minutes of the discussion, disagreements, and consensus made within the team in the form of **Minutes of Meeting**. At least three differences should be included and a clear documentation on how the final decisions were reached must be provided. The Minutes of Meeting should also record the division of labour and the considerations involved in the decision made.\n\nThe following links provided useful guides on how to prepare the minutes of a meeting:\n\n1.
